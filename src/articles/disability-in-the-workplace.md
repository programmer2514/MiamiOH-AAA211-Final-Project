# Disability in the Workplace
## Fostering an inclusive and productive work environment

Looking to support and include people with disabilities in the workplace? Here
are a few simple ideas to get you started:

### 1) Don't underestimate people with disabilities

Did you know that on average, people with disabilities only make 66% of what
their non-disabled counterparts make?<cite>[1]</cite> This is due to the
prevailing&mdash;and highly discriminatory&mdash;stereotype that people with
disabilities are less valuable employees.

This, however, is demonstrably false. In fact, studies have found that overall,
people with disabilities have higher levels of innovation, increased
productivity, lower employee turnover, and lower absenteeism rates than their
non-disabled counterparts.<cite>[2]</cite>

Thus, the first piece of advice for the workforce is: do not underestimate
people with disabilities. Despite the stereotypes, they are much more able than
society at large would have you believe.

### 2) Accommodate and include

In a corporate environment, accommodations are often seen as a waste of
funding&mdash;an unnecessary expense. But did you know that the opposite is
true?

Workplaces that hire people with disabilities have been shown to not only have
much more positive work environments, but a higher shareholder value as well.<cite>[2]</cite>

So the next time you hire someone into your team, consider asking them what
accommodations they may need. Not only will this foster a better employee
morale, providing the necessary accommodations for people to do their job
effectively is likely to increase productivity and boost your company's value
as well.

### 3) Foster open discussion of disability

An important part of employee morale and retention is ensuring that your
employees feel seen and heard by both the company and their peers.

If you want to create an inclusive, welcoming work environment, consider
fostering open, respectful discussion of disability. This not only helps people
to open up, it also helps prevent discrimination issues long before they even
happen.

### 4) Incorporate disability into DEI programs

Many companies have already witnessed the demonstrable benefits of a robust DEI
program, but most of them fail to include disability in that umbrella.

If you are looking for the next step for improving your company's work
environment, consider adding disability to your DEI program. You may be
surprised to find that many of your current employees would benefit from such a
program.

Additionally, this is likely to increase your company's appeal to both investors
and prospective employees.

### 5) Create with diversity in mind

Whether your company is an established giant in the construction industry,
an emerging tech startup, or anything in between, few things show your care for
the community more than designing with diversity in mind.

Whatever you create, from webpages to workplaces, give some thought to diverse
and disabled populations in your next design. Build your products with
accessibility in mind from the start, and your business will thank you.

### Conclusion

The tips above are just a few of the many ways that you can foster an inclusive,
equitable, and accessible workplace environment while boosting employee morale
and productivity at the same time.
