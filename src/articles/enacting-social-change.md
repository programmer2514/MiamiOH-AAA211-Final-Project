# Enacting Social Change
## How do I change society?

Congratulations! If you've gotten this far, you are already well on the way to
enacting social change for the better.

All too often, people feel stuck, unsure what to do to help. If that's you,
that's completely okay. Changing society can feel like an impossible task.

But it doesn't have to be.

Society is not a thing that can be changed, because it is not an
entity. Rather, it is the combination of the individual actions of every person
that is a part of it. This is where you come in.

All you need to do to change society is to act the way you want society to. If
you want to see people who have disabilities treated with respect, then treat
them with respect, and ensure that the people around you do as well.

You may feel really small in the face of a society so ingrained in its ways, but
every social change starts somewhere, and it doesn't have to be something big.

I promise you, one person doing the right thing, even if everyone else isn't,
means the world to those of us who are oppressed by society. Every ally seeking
to help change the future of people with disabilities for the better is another
step towards that better future.

So above all else, if you are seeking to make social change, I want to remind
you that you are enough, right where you are. Thank you.
