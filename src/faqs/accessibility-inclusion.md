To many people, these are synonymous. However, there are small key differences
between the two that make a very big difference.

Accessibility is exactly what it sounds like: Making something accessible to a
diverse range of people. This can look like having wheelchair ramps on a
building or using proper coding techniques on a website.

Inclusion on the other hand is a lot more nuanced and difficult. It goes beyond
simple accessibility and inherently calls for the equitable treatment of all.
Including someone is more than just making it possible for them to be
there&mdash;it's welcoming them in with the same treatment you would give
anybody else, regardless of who they are.

The difference between accessibility and inclusion is like the difference
between an unlocked and a vacant bathroom stall. The unlocked stall, you know
you *can* go in, but you're also not sure if someone just forgot to lock the
door, and so you feel a certain pressure not to go in just in case. The vacant
stall on the other hand, you feel fully comfortable entering, knowing that it is
completely acceptable for you to do so.

When you make a place accessible, you make it possible for someone to get to it.
When you make it inclusive, you invite the person in with open arms.
