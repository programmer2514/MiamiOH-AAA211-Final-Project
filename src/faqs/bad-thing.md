No, it isn't.

Many people with disabilities view their disability as a neutral or even
positive aspect of who they are. Rather than approaching it with a medical
mindset as something that needs to be fixed, they instead approach it with a
diversity mindset, where their disability is a beautiful part of what makes them
unique.

Assuming a person's disability is inherently bad can actually be discriminatory.
