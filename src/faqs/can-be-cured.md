The topic of curing disabilities is one that has been hotly debated in recent
years. The two sides are represented by two models: the Medical Model and the
Social Model.

The Medical Model centers around the idea that disabilities inherently need to
be fixed or cured. This approach is problematic as it leaves no room for
individual adaptation or for the whole host of disabilities that cannot be
cured. It often goes so far as to prioritize trying to fix someone over that
person's quality of life, and can be very harmful to people who do not view
their disabilities in a negative light.

The Social Model, however, takes a different approach, splitting impairment and
disability into two distinct categories. Under this model, impairment is the
bodily difference and disability is the social barrier related to it. This model
argues that regardless of whether or not the impairment can be cured, the real
problem is society's discriminatory and diversity-opposed attitude, which is
disabling people even further.

At the end of the day, a better question is not only whether they can be cured,
but whether they can be accommodated, included, and accepted.
