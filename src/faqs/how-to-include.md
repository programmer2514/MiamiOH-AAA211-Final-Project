There are many ways to include people with disabilities in both personal and
professional spaces.

If you would like to know more about including people with disabilities in your
personal life, check out the resource [Disability in Everyday Life](#disability-in-everyday-life).

If you would like to know more about including people with disabilities in the
workplace, check out the resource [Disability in the Workplace](#disability-in-the-workplace).

As always, these are only suggestions, and they vary from person to person. Your
best bet is always to ask the person you are seeking to include what they would
prefer.
