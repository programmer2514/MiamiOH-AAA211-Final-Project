Apart from this project's [Resources](#resources) section, several resources
exist online to help you continue your learning journey.

These include:

* [Disability & Health [CDC]](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/index.html) -
    A central hub for learning about disabilities of all kinds
* [Understood](https://www.understood.org/) -
    A nonprofit providing education and support materials specifically focused
    on learning and intellectual disabilities
* [Disability Resources](https://www.disabilityresources.org/) -
    A well-organized central archive of information and articles related to
    disability across the web
* [Center for Disability Rights](https://cdrnys.org/) -
    A New York nonprofit providing advocacy and support resources for people
    with disabilities of all kinds

As always, the best possible way to learn about any specific person or group of
people is to talk with them directly. The resources above are general, and may
not fully apply to every group of disabilities.
