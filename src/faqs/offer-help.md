The same way you would offer help to anyone else. Begin by asking if they need
anything, and don't force it if they say no.

Remember that people with disabilities are still just regular people, and treat
them accordingly. The only way they will be offended is if they feel like you
are being rude or patronizing.

As always, be kind, be open, and seek to learn. Have a conversation with them
about their disability if they are willing, and keep an open mind. You may just
learn something new along the way.
