Start small.

Talk to the people around you, start conversations about the topic, see if you
can get involved in a local organization.

Get familiar with the topic of disability and with common discriminatory
practices before creating flyers or handouts, and as always,
*get to know the people you are advocating for*.

You cannot possibly raise awareness for something you don't understand, so start
by learning, having those conversations, and discovering what the area around
you may need.
