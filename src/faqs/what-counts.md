A disability is, at its simplest, any bodily condition that interferes with a
person's ability to carry out normal tasks and activities. This includes things
such as blindness, deafness, and mobility impairments, as well as autism, ADHD,
OCD, arthritis, and colorblindness.

Disabilities vary in terms of severity and impact, and each is unique to the
individual affected. If you are unsure what a particular person's disability
entails, your best course of action is to ask them.
